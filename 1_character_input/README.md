# Problem
> Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

# Notes

- As a small added challenge we'll make this solution work such that it could run in 2025 (or any year other than this one) and still work.
    - Not going to hardcode the year.
