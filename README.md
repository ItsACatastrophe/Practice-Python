# Practice-Python

Small solutions to [Practice Python problems](https://www.practicepython.org/)

These problems seem fairly simple so ideally this will be an opportunity to focus on how the problem is solved (with a focus on elegance). It'll also be a good time to build a habit of using type hints in python.

## Setup

The python version in `.python-version` should be used just in case.
A list of packages many solutions in this repo use will be in `requirements.txt` for easy pip installation.

Assuming you have pyenv you can use this make command for setup:

```zsh
make install
```

Any other setup required for a given solution will be made available by using `make install` in the solution's directory.
